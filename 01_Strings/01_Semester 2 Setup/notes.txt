This semester we will have 2 repositories to pull from

The notes will be in a repo called POC_Sem2_Notes

These notes will be public so you don't need to setup any collaboration with them.   

Assignments will be given through a separate repo called POC_Sem2_Assignments

Today we will fork this repo to our github account.  You will have to periodically sync
this fork so that you can get the updated assignment descriptions.  

Folders will be automatically created for you.  You will have a file called
Description.txt next to a 
file that is called Assignment.py in every folder.  
Description.txt will contain the instructions.  
Assignment.py will be where you submit your work.   
When done you will have to sync your repo just like before.  
Please paste a link to your work in the Code HS assignment section so that it can be graded.
